# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## About the project 
I created an application that an employee can use to generate a random password length of 8-128. It prompts the user to select if they would like lower, upper, number, and/or special characters in their password. The page is responsive and works on different screen sizes. I used HTMl, CSS, and JavaScript to make this application.


The password can include special characters. If you’re unfamiliar with these, see this [list of Password Special Characters from the OWASP Foundation](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters).


## Mock-Up

I used Visual Studio code to build by website. Resources I used to help with the writing code are Stackoverflow, w3schools, and MDN developer mozilla. I used list of Password Special Characters from the OWASP Foundation] https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters. I would also like to thank my classmates for doing a study group to help each other out. I could not have done it without them.
